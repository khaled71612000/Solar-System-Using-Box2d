# Solar System Using Box2D

**Solar System Using Box2D** is a project that simulates a solar system using the Box2D physics engine in C++. This project demonstrates the use of Box2D for creating realistic physics simulations.

## Key Components

### PhysicsWorld.h
- Contains the implementation of the physics world using Box2D.
- Manages the creation and updating of celestial bodies and their interactions.

### Renderer.h
- Handles rendering of the solar system.
- Manages drawing the celestial bodies and visualizing their movements.

### Vector2d.h
- Defines a 2D vector class for mathematical operations.
- Used for position and movement calculations of celestial bodies.

## Features

- **Physics Simulation:** Realistic simulation of celestial bodies using Box2D.
- **Rendering:** Visualization of the solar system and its movements.
- **Vector Mathematics:** Custom 2D vector class for handling physics calculations.
